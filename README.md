## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Pseudo-classes (hover)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM

### What I learned

This is my second project from Frontend Mentor, and despite been similar to the first one I felt a great progress in the time I spent on it and the code quality.

In this project I used BEM methodology and the flexbox properties, allowing me to have a better control over how the tags behaved. Also, The CSS properties had a more structured order. Following this criteria:

1. Positioning
2. Box model
3. Typography
4. Visuals
5. Others

### Continued development

I still need to focus on a better git flow of commits with larger projects; and the responsive design implementation.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/) - Reading the documentation for CSS properties behavior
